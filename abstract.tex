	Our main objective in this project is to introduce the Monte Carlo algorithm in the context of option pricing. Because the simulation technique is used in various domains particularly in Financial Mathematics. Here we evaluate stock price, option price using tons of versions of MC method. Now, we have described this method for European, American and Barrier options respectively and showed some efficient method for reducing its computation time and increasing accuracy. For numerical results and graphical interpretation, we have used Python Language and shown their comparison with Black-Scholes Method.
